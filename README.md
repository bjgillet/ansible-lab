<H2>Ansible PoC playbooks</H2>
This is a set of very basic playbooks I used for Ansible and Ansible Tower integration within PoC context.
<br>
They are really basic (at most) but are useful to me to show integration capabilities within third party PoC integration.
<br>
<b>For someone looking at ansible:</b> you will only find basics ther, if it may help, feel free using them whatever the way.
<b>For someone with some background or expertise on Ansible:</b> Not sure it may help.
To all keep in mind those are just basic stuff so to prove integration capabilities through Ansible.
This being said, if it may help, feel free to reuse.
